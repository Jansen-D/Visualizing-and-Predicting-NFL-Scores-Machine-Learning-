# Visualizing-and-Predicting-NFL-Scores-Machine-Learning-
In addition to analyzing and visualizing NFL scores, I used Logistic and Multiple Linear Regression to predict the outcomes of NFL games.

- The data used here comes from the NFL scores dataset from kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/tobycrabtree/nfl-scores-and-betting-data?select=spreadspoke.R)

- In addition to the original data, I 'engineered' some additional columns such as current and away home records, as well as points scored per game as well as points scored against per game for both home and away teams

- The training dataset for the algorithms I used includes games from the 2015-2018 seasons. And the testing dataset included games from the 2019 regular season.

- I used logistic regression in order to predict the outcomes of the game (which team wins/loses)

- I used multiple variable linear regression to predict actual scores and spreads. These are less accurate than the game predictions but I was able to attain 66% accuracy when predicting game outcomes with multiple linear regression

STILL NEED TO ADD: Libraries, methods, visualizations, etc.
